The base fee represents the minimum fee required for a transaction to be included in a block on the blockchain. It is measured in gwei and compensates for the computational resources validators consume to process the transaction. The base fee is supplemented by a separate \"tip\" called the priority fee, which acts as an extra incentive for validators to prioritize the transaction. The priority fee is added to the base fee to calculate the final transaction fee.
